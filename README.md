# Alwin Solanky

Former gatekeeper turned poacher, with a background in Business analysis, QA and testing, I was under the false impression it was better to destroy than create.  I have seen the light and so want to start developing again as it is a true passion of mine as a junior developer, the seedling is there and just needs to be nurtured.  My background has given me a great perspective on how to test and hence the need for great clean test-driven code.  

## Skills

#### Communication
  Have made presentations at team and board level along with potential clients.

#### Mentoring
  Helped new graduates acclimatise to corporate company culture and also at Makers Academy enjoyed mentoring other team members in practices that I was more familiar with

#### Attention to detail
  With a background in Science and Testing attention to detail is paramount to what is required in the tasks that I'm involved in

#### Testing
  Having tested software for more than a decade it was great to apply this knowledge to TDD as a developer and understand from two different perspectives.

#### Willing to get involved
  Always happy to stretch myself as I believe that it is only outside your comfort zone that true growth happens
